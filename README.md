# How to Set Up
This project was implemented on our local machine using:
- Clone this repository 
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/product/neo4j-graph-database/)
- Setup Neo4j, create a new database, import `/Dataset csv's` into that database, import `/Schema/schema-neo4j.txt` to setup realtions for the dataset.
- Open terminal at the codebase `~.../airline-search-engine/`
- Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run code with `python3 main.py` in the `/Codebase/` folder.
